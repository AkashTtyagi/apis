   for file in database/migrations/workflow/*.sql; do
     mysql -u root -p your_database < "$file"
   done
   mysql -u root -p your_database < database/seeds/workflow_master_seed.sql
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy settings from `.env.workflow.example` to your `.env`
   - Update SMTP credentials

4. **Integrate routes:**
   ```javascript
   // In your main app.js or server.js
   const workflowRoutes = require('./src/routes/workflow.routes');
   app.use('/api/workflow', workflowRoutes);
   ```

5. **Initialize scheduler:**
   ```javascript
   const autoActionScheduler = require('./src/services/workflow/autoActionScheduler.service');
   const schedulers = autoActionScheduler.initializeScheduler();
   ```

6. **Test:**

## 🎓 Key Features Explained

### 1. Multi-Stage Approval
Create workflows with multiple approval stages:
- **Sequential:** Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3
- **Parallel:** Multiple approvers at same stage
- **AND logic:** All approvers must approve
- **OR logic:** Any one approver can approve
- **Custom routing:** Different paths on approve/reject

### 2. Conditional Logic (IF/ELSE)
Business rules that auto-approve, auto-reject, or route to different stages:
```
IF employee.available_balance < 0
  THEN auto_reject
  ELSE move_to_stage(Stage 1)

IF request.claim_amount > 5000
  THEN move_to_stage(Finance Head Approval)
  ELSE auto_approve
```

**Supported:**
- 11 operators: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, IN, NOT IN, CONTAINS, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
- AND/OR logic between rules
- Priority-based evaluation
- ELSE fallback actions

### 3. Dynamic Approver Resolution
Approvers resolved at runtime based on employee hierarchy:
- **REPORTING_MANAGER:** Employee's direct manager
- **RM_OF_RM:** Manager's manager
- **HOD:** Head of employee's department
- **FUNCTIONAL_HEAD:** Functional area head
- **HR_ADMIN:** HR administrator
- And 5 more types

### 4. Workflow Applicability
Same workflow type (e.g., Leave) can have different configurations:
- **Company A:** Simple 1-stage approval
- **Company B:** Complex 3-stage approval
- **IT Department:** Skip manager, go to HOD
- **Finance Department:** Additional CFO approval
- **Senior employees:** Auto-approve

**Priority-based matching** ensures right workflow is selected.

### 5. Auto-Actions & SLA
Time-based automatic actions:
- **Auto-approve** if pending > X days
- **Auto-reject** if pending > X days
- **Escalate** to higher authority
- **Send reminders** to pending approvers
- **SLA breach alerts**

**Cron jobs run:**
- Every 1 hour: Check expired requests
- Every 30 minutes: Send SLA warnings

### 6. Email Notifications
Template-based emails with dynamic content:
- **40+ placeholders:** {{employee_name}}, {{request_number}}, {{leave_type}}, etc.
- **Event-based:** submission, approval, rejection, escalation, etc.
- **TO, CC, BCC support**
- **SMTP integration:** Gmail, Office 365, SendGrid, etc.

### 7. Complete Audit Trail
Every action is logged:
- Who approved/rejected
- When (timestamp)
- Why (remarks)
- IP address
- User agent
- Email sent status

## 🔍 Real-World Use Cases Implemented

### Use Case 1: Simple Leave Approval
```
Employee → Reporting Manager → Approved/Rejected
```

### Use Case 2: Leave with Auto-Reject
```
IF balance < 0 → Auto-reject
ELSE → Reporting Manager → Approved/Rejected
```

### Use Case 3: High-Value Expense Claim
```
IF amount > 5000:
  Employee → Manager → Finance Head → CFO → Approved
ELSE:
  Employee → Manager → Approved
```

### Use Case 4: Auto-Escalation
```
Employee → Manager (2 days SLA)
If no action → Auto-escalate to RM's Manager
If still no action → Auto-approve
```

### Use Case 5: Department-Specific Workflows
```
IT Department: Employee → HOD → Approved
Finance Department: Employee → Manager → Finance Head → CFO → Approved
HR Department: Employee → HR Manager → Approved
```
